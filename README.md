# The Amazing Tax Calculator

The **Amazing Tax Calculator** is a powerful simulation tool designed to model how taxes reduce income over multiple cycles of earning and spending. By considering salary taxes and value-added taxes (VAT), along with a personal tax credit (**persónuafsláttur**), the calculator helps demonstrate the cumulative impact of taxation on an individual's income.

## Key Features:
- **Salary Tax Calculation**: Automatically applies a user-defined salary tax rate to calculate how much tax is deducted from income.
- **VAT Simulation**: Models how value-added taxes (VAT) are collected every time money is spent.
- **Persónuafsláttur (Personal Tax Credit)**: Reduces the overall tax burden by applying a personal tax credit to the salary tax. This ensures that a portion of the tax is forgiven, depending on the value of the persónuafsláttur.
- **Multiple Cycles**: Simulates the flow of money over several cycles, showing how the remaining money decreases after each round of salary and spending.
- **Detailed History**: Tracks each cycle’s events, including salary tax, VAT, and how much money the government collects.
- **Visual Graphs**: Plots the reduction of money over time, allowing for easy visualization of how quickly taxes reduce the available funds in circulation.

## How It Works:
1. **Input Parameters**: 
   - Initial salary
   - Salary tax rate
   - VAT rate
   - Persónuafsláttur (personal tax credit)
   - Number of cycles (iterations)

2. **Tax Application**:
   - For each cycle, salary tax is applied first.
   - The persónuafsláttur is deducted from the calculated tax, reducing the tax burden.
   - After taxes, the remaining money is spent, and VAT is applied to the spending.

3. **Final Results**: 
   - The tool calculates how much money the government has collected over time and how much of the initial salary is still circulating in the economy after the defined number of cycles.

## Use Case:
This calculator is ideal for demonstrating the effects of taxation on an individual’s salary, providing a clear and easy-to-understand view of how income decreases over time due to taxes. It’s perfect for educational purposes, financial analysis, and tax policy simulations.

## Example:
Imagine starting with an initial salary of 1,100 kr and a tax rate of 35%. Over 12 cycles of earning and spending, with VAT and a personal tax credit of 50 kr, this calculator shows how much of the salary is left and how much the government collects in total.

## Visual Output:
The calculator also generates a graph that illustrates the remaining money over multiple cycles, giving a clear visual of how quickly funds are depleted through taxation.
